In this Python project, I are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

  Here are the 5 steps to create a chatbot in Python from scratch:
      
      1 . Import and load the data file
      2 . Preprocess data
      3 . Create training and testing data
      4 . Build the model
      5 . Predict the response
